# CSS-testing-

This repositry will be a css testing and learning repo!

I just started with css and i made this repository to start styling my code with css. In this README i will go do a generic overview of how i am doing during this course by writing comments, words and text. also things that maybe are good to remember and stuff i feel is important.

The first things i notice in some youtube tutorials and how there is internal and external ways to use css i will obviously use external but i feel like using some internal css in the begging can help you with becoming familiar with the words and code to use.

well i made na external stylesheet and started changing stuff, background color, test color. it was really easy?!
